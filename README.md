# NewsProject

This is a test project for job opening. And skill showcase in some degree, I guess.

Full task description here - http://testtask.sebbia.com/swagger-ui.html#!/news-controller/detailsUsingGET

I've spent around 19-20 hours completing the task. That's including some time on studying/reading about Retrofit2, Hilt, View Binding, mb some other stuff. (all off which was relatively new to me)

In current state I don't really like transitions between different screen, I would like to add Loading and Fail states sometime in the future
